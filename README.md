# PRODIGY_ML_02: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This repository contains the implementation of a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The project is developed as part of an internship at Prodigy Infotech.

## Dataset

📊 The dataset used for this project is the [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) available on Kaggle. It consists of customer information including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Files

- **Mall Customer Segmentation.ipynb**: 📓 This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm and performing customer segmentation using the provided dataset.
- **requirements.txt**: 📋 This file lists all the dependencies required to run the code successfully. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

## Usage

🚀 To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `Mall Customer Segmentation.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code and observe the results.
